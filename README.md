# Amphibians Android App

## Overview
Amphibians is an Android app that displays various amphibians' information, including their names, types, images, and descriptions fetched from an API. The app leverages modern Android development tools and best practices to provide a clean and efficient user experience.

## Features
- Display a list of amphibians with their names, types, images, and descriptions.
- Fetch data from a REST web service using Retrofit.
- Utilize Jetpack Compose for building the user interface.
- Manage UI-related data using ViewModel.
- Separate the UI layer and the data layer for better code organization.
- Load images efficiently with Coil library.
- Parse JSON responses using kotlinx.serialization.
- Implement Repository pattern for data handling.
- Use Dependency Injection for better code maintainability.
- Perform unit testing on ViewModel and Repository.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: For building UI components.
- **ViewModel**: For managing UI-related data.
- **Coil**: For loading images.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests.
- **kotlinx.serialization**: For parsing JSON responses.
- **Web Services**: To interact with the API.
- **Repository Pattern**: For handling data operations.
- **Dependency Injection**: For managing dependencies.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing ViewModel and Repository.
